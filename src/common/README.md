##Common
This folder is using to save common files. Usually, it could be separated into multiple inner folders: components mixins directives etc, or single files: functions.ts helpers.ts constants.ts config.ts and other. The main reason to put a file into this folder is using it in many places. For example: inside src/common/components you can store Button.vue â€” the shared component, used throughout the whole application. In helpers.ts you can write a common function to use it in multiple places. Here we want to save fonts, icons, images, styles etc.
